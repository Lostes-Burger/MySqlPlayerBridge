  # Only important if you have an existing server with saved player data
  # Important: If you are deploying this plugin on an existing server with saved player data,
  # it can happen that the data from the wrong server is saved.
  # For example, a player has important data on server1 but none on server2 (e.g., a farm world).
  # If the player joins server1 first, everything is fine — the data is created in the database and transferred to server2.
  # However, if the player joins server2 first, before the data from server1 is saved,
  # the empty data will be saved and transferred back to server1, effectively deleting the original data.
  # To avoid this problem, you can enable "no-entry-protection" below.
  # Set it to true only on servers that should *not* be treated as the source of the default player data
  # (in this example: server2 = true, server1 = false).
  # If this option is enabled and a player joins without existing data (for all enabled sync modules),
  # the connection will be denied and no data will be saved.
